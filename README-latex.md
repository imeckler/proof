proof
====

**Proof** is a collection of tools constituting a new way of
writing and reading proofs inspired by the ideas of
[Leslie Lamport](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/lamport-how-to-write.pdf).

At the end of the day, the aim of these tools is to end up with
a beautiful, interactive proof page like [this](todoexample).


**Proof** is a markup language for writing structured proofs which compiles to an HTML page. It is heavily inspired by the ideas of [Leslie Lamport](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/lamport-how-to-write.pdf) and by type-theory based proof assistants (specifically [Coq](http://coq.inria.fr/) and [Agda](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php)). The aim and the promise of structured proofs is to make mathematics
